# Integration Testing in React Native Task Management App

This document outlines our approach to integration testing in our React Native task management application, with special focus on component interaction testing.

## What is Integration Testing?

Integration testing verifies that different modules or services used by your application work well together. In the context of React Native, integration tests focus on how components communicate and interact with each other, but without launching a full device or emulator.

## Why Integration Testing Matters for React Native

In our React Native task management application, many features require multiple components to interact:
- Task creation requires the input form and task list to communicate
- Task reordering requires drag-and-drop functionality to update the task list state
- Task completion and deletion require task items to communicate with the parent list

Integration tests give us confidence that these components work correctly together without the overhead of full E2E testing on devices.

## Integration Tests in Our React Native Application

### Task Addition Integration Test

```javascript
import { render, fireEvent, screen } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import App from '../App';

test('Can add new tasks to the list', () => {
  render(<App />);
  
  // Add a task
  const input = screen.getByPlaceholderText('Add a task...');
  const addButton = screen.getByText('Add');
  
  fireEvent.changeText(input, 'Buy groceries');
  fireEvent.press(addButton);
  
  // Verify task was added to the list
  expect(screen.getByText('Buy groceries')).toBeTruthy();
  // Input should be cleared
  expect(input.props.value).toBeFalsy();
});
```

## React Native Integration Testing Tools

Our application uses:
- Jest as the test runner
- React Native Testing Library for component rendering and queries
- Custom utilities for complex interactions like drag-and-drop

## React Native-Specific Testing Considerations

1. **Native Component Mocking**: Some React Native components may need mocking
2. **Platform-Specific Behavior**: Test platform-specific code carefully
3. **Animations**: Disable or mock animations during tests
4. **Gesture Handling**: Drag-and-drop and other gestures require special handling
5. **Async Storage**: Mock AsyncStorage for tests involving persistence

## Best Practices for React Native Integration Testing

1. **Focus on component interactions** rather than implementation details
2. **Use testID props** for reliable component identification
3. **Test user workflows** from the perspective of how components interact
4. **Mock native modules** when necessary
5. **Organize tests by feature** rather than by component

## How to Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific integration test
npm test -- --testPathPattern=tests/integration/taskReordering.test.js
```

## Testing Drag and Drop in React Native

Testing drag and drop in React Native presents unique challenges:

1. **Gesture Simulation**: Standard testing libraries don't fully simulate complex gestures
2. **Custom Utility Functions**: We've created custom test utilities to simulate drag operations
3. **Library-Specific Approaches**: Different drag-and-drop libraries require different testing approaches


## When to Use Integration Tests vs. Unit or E2E Tests in React Native

- **Unit tests**: For testing individual component rendering and props handling
- **Integration tests**: For testing interactions between multiple components
- **E2E tests** (with Detox or Appium): For testing complete user flows on actual devices

Integration tests are ideal for our drag-and-drop functionality since it involves multiple components working together but doesn't require a full device environment to verify.
